# Codefolio Showcase Platform

## Project Summary:
The Codefolio Showcase Platform is a cloud-native application designed to dynamically display software projects in a portfolio on a personal or company website. Utilizing a serverless architecture on AWS, the platform offers a cost-effective, scalable, and easy-to-manage solution for developers and companies to highlight their projects to potential clients or employers. The platform features a DynamoDB table for storing project data, a Lambda function for backend logic, an API Gateway for RESTful endpoint exposure, and a CloudFormation template for resource orchestration.

## Objective:

To develop a scalable, serverless platform that allows for the efficient showcasing of software projects on a website, with the goals of maximizing performance, minimizing costs, and providing an intuitive management interface for project data.
### Key Features:
- Dynamic Project Display: Projects are fetched in real-time from a DynamoDB table, ensuring that the portfolio is always up-to-date with the latest work.
- Serverless Backend: Utilizes AWS Lambda for handling backend logic, allowing for automatic scaling and payment for only the compute time used.
- RESTful API: API Gateway exposes a RESTful API to the frontend, enabling easy integration with any web development framework or technology.
- Cost-Effective: The use of AWSâ€™s managed services reduces the need for manual scaling and maintenance, significantly lowering operational costs.
- Easy Deployment: The entire infrastructure is defined as code using AWS CloudFormation, allowing for easy replication, deployment, and version control of the infrastructure.

Technology Stack:

- AWS DynamoDB: NoSQL database service for storing and retrieving project data.
- AWS Lambda: Event-driven, serverless computing service for executing backend logic.
- AWS API Gateway: Service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing RESTful APIs.
- AWS CloudFormation: Service for modeling and setting up AWS resources using code.
- Python: Runtime for the Lambda function (or any supported runtime as per project requirements).
